# HanziLens
HanziLens provides an intuitive visualization for dissecting Chinese sentences. The visual breakdown can help in understanding sentence structure and vocabulary in context. 

Splits a Chinese sentence into its words (詞語), and gives the reading and English meaning of each word in the context of the sentence.

Done by prompting Qwen2.5 72B for a structured output.

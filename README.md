# ReadAssist/ReadOverview

### Issues/Todo
- Sometimes AI gives all definitions from an entry
- Sometimes AI gives two definitions if they are similar/both are relevant 
  - e.g. xi huan to like; to be fond of
  - Need to figure out what you want to about those
- Input sanitization, handle inputs:
  - that aren't Chinese sentences
  - that are longer
- Some cases where pinyin reading has a colon to denote tone: e.g. nu:3 (å¥³)

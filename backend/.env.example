# ============================================
# Two-Stage Pipeline Configuration (Recommended)
# ============================================
# Uses specialized models for each stage to optimize throughput and quality.
# Stage 1: Segmentation - fast model, good at Chinese parsing (~75 tps)
# Stage 2: Alignment - model with better translation-to-segment mapping (~93% validity)

# Stage 1: Segmentation model (fast, good at Chinese)
# Recommended: qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct
OPENROUTER_SEGMENTATION_MODEL=qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct

# Stage 2: Translation alignment model
# Recommended: xiaomi/mimo-v2-flashfree
OPENROUTER_ALIGNMENT_MODEL=xiaomi/mimo-v2-flashfree

# ============================================
# Single Model Fallback (Alternative)
# ============================================
# If SEGMENTATION_MODEL and ALIGNMENT_MODEL are not set,
# this model will be used for both stages.
# Note: You must set EITHER the two-stage models above OR this single model.

# Vision Model (for image OCR)
# ============================================
# Vision model for image OCR parsing (must support vision/images)
# Recommended options:
# - openai/gpt-4o (excellent OCR, fast)
# - anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 (great at Chinese understanding)
# - google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 (fast, cost-effective)
